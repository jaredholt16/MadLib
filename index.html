Some people like them   <span class="adjective"></span>  , but I prefer them   <span class="adjective"></span>  . After  searching for hours I usually   <span class="adverb"></span>   exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over   there!" Off we    <span class="verb"></span>   to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the  <span class="noun"></span>   and the  <span class="noun"></span>  . But at the end of the day we    <span class="adverb"></span>   get the tree and head home    <span class="adverb"></span>  . "I wish it was Christmas all year round"  I    <span class="adverb"></span>   think to myself.

                Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a   <span class="adjective"></span>     <span class="noun"></span>  , who upon noticing me    <span class="adverb"></span>   said "I need to   <span class="verb"></span>  ". "Well,   that was   <span class="adjective"></span>  " I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\s inventory, so I felt    <span class="adverb"></span>   lost. I   walked up to store clerk and said    <span class="adverb"></span>   "I am looking for a   <span class="adjective"></span>     <span class="noun"></span>   that doesnâ€™t    <span class="verb"></span>   as often as the last one I had." The store clerk    looked at me with a   <span class="adjective"></span>   look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the   <span class="noun"></span>  , if you see a   <span class="noun"></span>   that    <span class="adverb"></span>   can    <span class="verb"></span>  , then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it    on amazon.com, Their products seem to    <span class="verb"></span>   the perfect amount

                Many say that brainstorming is   <span class="adjective"></span>   and does not   <span class="verb"></span>  . However, with the combination of the right computer and   <span class="noun"></span>   anyone  can lead a good    <span class="verb"></span>  . When you have    <span class="adverb"></span>   pulled together a   <span class="adjective"></span>      group of   <span class="noun"></span>   in a big room with lots of TVs then  magical things will happen. In the past we have    <span class="adverb"></span>   suggested  participants work together to find the most   <span class="adjective"></span>   solution. The   most difficult part is many   <span class="adjective"></span>     <span class="noun"></span>   like to   <span class="verb"></span> . This has proved to be    <span class="adverb"></span>   problematic.  But in the end the most important   <span class="noun"></span>   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    <span class="verb"></span>  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    <span class="adverb"></span>   listening!
